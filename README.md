# FlaskSentimentAnalysis
Created a web app integrated with Watson AI libraries to perform sentiment analysis on the provided text. After developing the app, it is deployed over the web using Flask framework.
In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that
sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems,
automated chat bots, and so on.
